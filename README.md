# what I learned after building this app :
1.create custom views using .xib files to modify native design components.

2.embed View Controllers in a Navigation Controller and understand the navigation stack.

3.create a constants file and use static properties to store Strings and other constants.

4.App Lifecycle and how to use viewWillAppear or viewWillDisappear.

5.create direct Segues for navigation.
